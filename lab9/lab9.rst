   - dc.greensafe.lab
   - win-id-platform.greensafe.lab (the CIP server)

Configure System Sets
*********************

Systems have been added into the Centrify Identity Platform and while global and role-based permissions have been applied, there will be instances where systems need to be grouped based on their role within the organization. In this exercise, Alex (you) will create a number of system sets that will be configured and shared with other privileged users. Additionally, you will understand how to apply role-based permissions to the members of the set as well as the set itself.

#. Using the main menu on the left to navigate to *Resources > Systems* to display all systems
#. Using Google Chrome Menu, establish a *New Incognito Window* so you can login as different users and confirm the information in the table below:

   .. list-table::
         :widths: 10 20 10 30
         :header-rows: 1
      
         * - Username
           - AD Group
           - Centrify Role
           - Available Systems
         * - jmiller@greensafe.lab
           - Domain Admins
           - PAS Admin Role
           - apps-server.greensafe.lab, apps-unix.greensafe.lab, db-server.greensafe.lab, db-unix.greensafe.lab, dc.greensafe.lab
         * - bhughes@greensafe.lab
           - Team_Helpdesk

           - Team_Contractors
           - Contractors Role
           - No Systems

   .. note::
       You will notice that due to role based administrative rights applied earlier, the main menu at the left will look different for specific users. 
       
       | You will also notice that due to global system permissions applied earlier, systems are viewable to Joe Miller (jmiller@greensafe.lab) and Bob Hughes (bhughes@greensafe.lab). 

#. Return to the Centrify Identity Platform (*logged in as Ales Foster*) and navigate to *Resources > Systems* click the **Add** button on the **far right under Sets**

           - apps-unix.greensafe.lab, db-unix.greensafe.lab
         * - Greensafe Contractor Supported
           - db-server.greensafe.lab, db-unix.greensafe.lab
   
   .. note::
       Once completed, the sets are currently available to Alex Foster (you). The next steps will be to assign permissions to others to see the set and to set explicit permissions to the members of the sets without assigning the permission to each system individually.
       
       | If you have made a mistake and want to remove a system from a set, select the set and the to be removed system, not systems!!, and under the **Action** button, slect *Remove from this Set*
       
       .. figure:: images/lab-021.png

   .. figure:: images/lab-022.png

#. Under *Permissions*, click the **Add** button
#. Search for **PAS Admin Role** and click **Add**
#. Under PAS Admin Role permissions, assign **View** permissions
#. Click **Save**. This change will grant PAS Administrators permission to see the system set when they login
#. Use the main menu on the left to navigate to *Resources > Systems*
#. Right Click on the *Greensafe Windows Servers* set and click **Modify**
#. Under *Permissions*, click the **Add** button
#. Search for **PAS Admin Role** and **PAS Power User Role** click **Add**
#. Under each of the roles added, confirm the **View** permissions has been added
#. Click **Save**. This change will grant PAS Administrators and PAS Power Users permission to see the system set when they login
#. Use the main menu on the left to navigate to *Resources > Systems*
#. Right-click on the *Greensafe Unix Servers* set and click **Modify**
#. Under *Permissions*, click the *Add* button.
#. Search for **PAS Admin Role** and **PAS Power User Role** and click **Add**
#. Under each of the roles added, confirm the **View** permissions has been added.

#. Search for **PAS Admin Role** and **PAS Power User Role** and click **Add**
#. Under each of the roles added, confirm the **View** permissions has been added.
#. Click **Save**. This change will grant PAS Administrators and PAS Power Users permission to see the system set when they login

   .. note::
       Now that permissions are assigned to view the set, let’s assign permissions to members of specific sets.

#. Use the main menu on the left to navigate to *Resources > Systems*
#. Right-click on the *Greensafe Unix Servers* set and click **Modify**
#. Under *Member Permissions*, click the** Add** button
#. Search for **Team_UnixAdmins** and click **Add**
#. Under the *Team_UnixAdmin* Permissions, confirm the **View** permissions has been added.
#. Click **Save**
#. Use the main menu on the left to navigate to *Resources > Systems*
#. Right Click on the *Greensafe Contractor Supported* set and click **Modify**
#. Under *Member Permissions*, click the **Add** button
#. Search for **Contractor Role** and click **Add**
#. Under the *Contractor Role* Permissions, confirm the **View** permissions has been added.
#. Click Save.

   .. note::
       Now permissions have been assigned to specific groups to see specific sets. We have also assigned member permissions to specific groups so individual system permissions do not need to be assigned individually. Now let’s confirm the permissions, using the same accounts we worked with at the beginning of the exercise.

#. Using Google Chrome Menu, establish a New Incognito Window so you can login as each of the users (on the following page) to confirm the information in the table.

   .. list-table::

#. Launch PuTTY and login to *db-unix.greensafe.lab* with the following credentials:
   
   - **Username:** root
   - **Password:** *Provided by Trainer*

#. Run the following command to install the Centrify DirectAudit Agent:

   .. code-block:: bash

   - gpupdate /force
   - ipconfig

   .. figure:: images/lab-010.png

#. Once completed, **exit PowerShell**
#. Use the *Start Menu > Windows Administrative Tools > Windows Firewall and Advanced Security*
#. Logout of the session, *Start Menu > User Icon > Sign Out*

   .. figure:: images/lab-011.png

#. Let’s open another session using a UNIX system. Launch PuTTY and login to the db-unix.greensafe.lab server with the following credentials:
   
   - **Username:** lbennett@greensafe.lab
   - **Password:** *Provided by Trainer*

#. Let’s document this session so other auditors and management have the auditor’s notes. Click *Session > Update Review Status* and select **to be Reviewed**

   .. figure:: images/lab-012.png

#. Add notes related to the session:"witnessed.." and click **OK**. You can then *close* this session

This fifth lab will cover:

1. Install the Centrify Agent
3. Join to AD (Unix) and correct Zone
2. Configure the Centrify Agent

.. note::
    Estimated time to complete this lab: **15 minutes**

In this exercise, Alex (you) will configure the Centrify Zone Provisioning Agent (ZPA) to automatically provision and deprovision users and groups for access to privileged resources. This will include the configuration of a domain service account that will facilitate this automation as users are added to monitored groups.
